# TODO

* Assemler test for each instruction
   * Get an overview of what is implemented (and add to TODO)
 * Memory: read in first state, write in second. Is this how we want to do it?
 * Take a note on: semantic changed to have opd in words, halfword, or bytes, but address in bytes
 * Looks like Morten's simulator/compiler sign extends ldindb/h, Check it
   * and document it
 * Explore Tjark's test generation (with cosimulation)
 * Use the C compiler
 * Run C compiler tests
 * Are half word load stores used in the compiler?
   * Any instruction not used by theb compiler 
 * Accu byte enables
 * load/store byte indirect
 * Does subi sign extend? Do we need a subi? We could use addi with neg. values
 * Get a simple sequential version done
   * Pipelined version follows
 * Run Morten's C test programs
 * gcc test suit as in Patmos
 * Shouldn't a cross-compiler have a prefix? Such as leros-clang?

## Documentation

 * Get text from paper into handbook, including the instruction figure

## Missing Instructions (tests and/or implementation)

* add (test)
* sub (test)
* and (test)
* or (test)
* xor (test)
* xori (test)
* loadi (test for sign extension, also high versions)
* out
* in
* jal
* ldind (offset broken now, as it counts for ldindb, test missing)
* ldindh
* stind (offset broken now, as it counts for ldindb, test missing)
* stindb
* stindh
* br
* brz
* brnz
* brp
* brn

## Semantic Questions

 * Do add/sub immediate sign extend? I guess so.
 * Logic immediate operations shall not sign extend
